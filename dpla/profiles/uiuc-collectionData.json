It is a rare collection of original materials on the theatre comprising over 5000 items from more than 150 productions in England and the United States. These materials include costume and set designs, sketches, notes, photographs, prop lists, storyboards, and swatches of fabric. A sample of sketches from some of the productions were digitized from slides made of the images and then indexed to create a database for scholars and others interested in theatre history"}, "collMetadataDetail": {"itemCount": 4085, "dateProfiled": "26/10/2015", "Source": "Remote", "collectionVolume": {"creator": 0, "rightsHolder": 0, "relation": 8168, "displayDate": 3667, "contributor": 0, "alternative": 0, "dataProvider": 4085, "subject": 21337, "title": 4085, "temporal": 0, "provider": 4085, "type": 4085, "description": 9591, "format": 10391, "collection": 4085, "spatialCoords": 0, "replacedBy": 0, "extent": 0, "genre": 0, "publisher": 0, "replaces": 0, "language": 0, "rights": 4085, "spatialName": 0, "identifier": 0}, "collectionUsage": {"creator": 0, "rightsHolder": 0, "relation": 4085, "displayDate": 3667, "contributor": 0, "alternative": 0, "dataProvider": 4085, "subject": 4085, "title": 4085, "temporal": 0, "provider": 4085, "type": 4085, "description": 4027, "format": 4046, "collection": 4085, "spatialCoords": 0, "replacedBy": 0, "extent": 0, "genre": 0, "publisher": 0, "replaces": 0, "language": 0, "rights": 4085, "spatialName": 0, "identifier": 0}}, "duplicated_item": []}
