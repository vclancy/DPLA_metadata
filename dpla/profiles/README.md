# What is this?

These profiles are from the project work done in Fall 2015.  We're not sure what all we can use it for.
collprofile files have the following structure:
```
object		{4}
	collection		{4}
	collMetadataDetail		{5}
	duplicated_item
	itemDetail		[count of items]
		item1		{2}
			itemId	
				attrVolume		{25}
					description	
					creator	
					rightsHolder	
					collection	
					spatialCoords	
					genre	
					relation	
					displayDate	
					extent	
					contributor
